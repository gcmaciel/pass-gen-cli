# pass-gen-cli

**pass-gen-cli** is a command-line program to generate random passwords. It was designed to include one capitalized letter, one special character and lower case letters.

## Usage

To use this program is quite simple. It takes one argument (which is a number) to tell the program the length of the password you want.

Then, a new password is generated and shown as an output.

#### Example

This generates a 20 characters password...
```bash
$ ./password 20
```
...like this
```bash
U$0ptkjmixepvjxujodu
```

#### Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gcmaciel/pass-gen-cli.git
