# pass-gen-cli

## Description

**pass-gen-cli** is a command-line program to generate random passwords. It was designed to include one capitalized letter, one special character and lower case letters.

## Motivation

I decided to make this program because I always took too long to create passwords from my head.

Of course there are lots of passwords generators out there but I wanted to write one myself.

## Usage

To use this program is quite simple. It takes one argument (which is a number) to tell the program the length of the password you want. A new password is generated and shown as an output.

### Example

```
# This generates a 20 characters passwords
$ ./password 20
U$0ptkjmixepvjxujodu
```
